A school assigns grades to students based on their exam scores as follows:

Score Range  | Grade
-------------|-------
90 and above | A
80–89        | B
70–79        | C
50–69        | D
35–49        | E
Below 35     | F

Write a JavaScript function grade(score) that:
1. Takes a student's score as input.
2. Determines the grade based on the above table.
3. Prints "You have passed with <grade> grade. Score is <score>" if the student’s grade is not "F".
4. Prints "You have failed with F grade. Score is <score>" if the student’s grade is "F".

Example:
grade(92); // Output: You have passed with A grade. Score is 92
grade(20); // Output: You have failed with F grade. Score is 20
